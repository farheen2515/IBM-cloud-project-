intelligence classification of rural infrastructure project 
problem statement 
The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) aims to build all-weather roads to connect rural villages in India. Over time, this scheme has evolved into multiple phases like PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, RCPLWEA, etc., each with different goals and rules.

Today, it’s tough for government officials to manually classify each project correctly due to complex data formats and multiple parameters. Manual sorting is slow, error-prone, and inefficient.

Goal of This Project:
To build an AI-powered classification system that can automatically categorize rural infrastructure projects into the correct PMGSY phase using their physical and financial details—saving time, avoiding errors, and helping officials make better decisions.
